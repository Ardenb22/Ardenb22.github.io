	<h1> The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins 
 </h1>
<p>The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a dystopian adventure novel. One of the main characters Katniss goes to the Hunger games because her sister was chosen as the district twelve female tribute and she volunteered herself to save her sister. She will be going to the Hunger Games with Peeta Mellark, the district twelve male tribute. Will they work together in the end to survive the Hunger Games and outlive the other twenty two tributes or will Katniss lose her life to save her sisters. I guess youâ€™ll just have to read to find out.
